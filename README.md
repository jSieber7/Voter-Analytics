# Code Repository for Visual Analytics Project

This project's primary goal is to create voter profiles using data from the General Social Survey. Two secondary objectives are to learn more about voters and to build a brand centered around voter's preferences.

Note: If you are going to use Juypter to look at the .ipynb files, I highly recommend installing Jupyter Lab and using the table of contents extension for easy navigation.

```
# Installing Jupyter Lab
pip install jupyterlab

# Installing the Jupyer Lab TOC extension
jupyter labextension install @jupyterlab/toc
```
